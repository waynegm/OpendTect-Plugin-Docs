# Installation

For both Linux and Windows there are 2 alternatives, site wide installation or per-user installation.

## Linux

### Sitewide Installation
To install the plugins into the OpendTect program folder (eg __/opt/seismic/OpendTect/5.0/ __):

1. Copy the contents of the __bin/lux64/Release/__ folder in the tgz file to __/opt/seismic/OpendTect/5.0.0/bin/lux64/Release/__;

2. Copy the contents of the __plugins/lux64/__ folder in the tgz file to __/opt/Seismic/OpendTect/5.0.0/plugins/lux64/__; and

3. Restart OpendTect.

### Per-user Installation

On Linux it is also possible to install the plugin files in a users __.od__ folder. Note that the OpendTect-4-plugins won't work in OpendTect 5+ and the OpendTect-5-plugins won't work in OpendTect 4. See the [FAQ](faq.md) for a workaround if you want to use this method of installation and want to run both versions of OpendTect.

1. Copy the contents of the __bin/lux64/Release/__ folder in the tgz file to the users __.od/bin/lux64/Release/__ folder;

2. Copy the contents of the __plugins/lux64/__ folder in the tgz file to the users __.od/plugins/lux64/__ folder; and

3. Restart OpendTect.

## Windows

### Sitewide Installation
To install the plugins into the OpendTect program folder (eg __c:\Program Files\opendtect\ __):

1. Copy the contents of the __bin\win64\Release\ __ folder in the zip file to __c:\Program Files\opendtect\bin\win64\Release\ __;

2. Copy the contents of the __plugins\win64\ __ folder in the zip file to __c:\Program Files\opendtect\plugins\win64\ __; and

3. Restart OpendTect.

### Per-user Installation

On Windows it is also possible to install the plugin files in a users __.od__ folder. Note that the OpendTect-4-plugins won't work in OpendTect 5+ and the OpendTect-5-plugins won't work in OpendTect 4. See the [FAQ](faq.md) for a workaround if you want to use this method of installation and want to run both versions of OpendTect.
